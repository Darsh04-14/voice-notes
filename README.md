   Lecture-Lenz is a web application developed by a group of 
  engineering students to enhance the learning experience for 
 students during lectures. It uses AI and voice recognition to 
 record audio from lectures, providing live transcriptions with 
   captions to help students keep up with the lecture content. 
  After the lecture, the transcription is used to create notes 
 and quizzes. The application was built using React.js, Node.js, 
  Express.js, Firebase, GCP, and OpenAI's API, with a focus on 
 efficient state management to reduce latency. The team plans to 
      add features like exporting notes to note-taking apps, 
downloading notes as PDF files, and enhancing quiz functionality 
                    in the future.
